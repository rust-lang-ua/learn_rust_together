## How to do exersices

First of all, you need to fork the [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng) into a **private** repo.
For each exercise, you'll need to create separate pull requests.
Then, when the reviewer checks and approves your pull request, you can merge it into the master/main branch. After that, the exercise will be considered done.

1. [Create](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng/generate) a new [GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) for yourself using this one [as template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Don't forget to make it private.

 - Go to the [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng)
 - Find the button "Use as template" click and choose "create a new repository".

 - Here we are. The private fork is ready. Look for it in the list of your repositories.
 
2. [Invite as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) of your repository our reviewers. 
 - In the main page of your repository go to the "Settings" section.
